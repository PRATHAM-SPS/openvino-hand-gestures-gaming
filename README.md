# Hand Gesture Recognition for Racing Games using OpenVINO

Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition project leveraging the power of  OpenVINO! ðŸš—ðŸŽ®

## Overview

This project utilizes Intel's OpenVINO toolkit to create a real-time hand gesture recognition system tailored for racing games such as Asphalt 9, Beach Buggy Racing, and NFS Most Wanted. By harnessing the power of edge AI, this system enables players to control in-game actions through intuitive hand gestures, offering a more immersive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Palm Detection**: Identify and localize palms in the game environment with high accuracy.
- **Hand Landmark Recognition**: Recognize key landmarks on the hand to interpret gestures effectively.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Achieve low-latency gesture recognition for seamless interaction during gameplay.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple instructions for setting up the system, ensuring accessibility for all users.
